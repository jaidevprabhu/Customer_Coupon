# Berkeley AI + ML Professional Certification Course

## Assignment 5.1 - Will the customer accept the coupon?

In this project, we inspect the data available from UCI ML Repo - \
[title] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/603/data.csv)

This data contains information regarding coupon acceptance by drivers whose characteristics were known and offered a specific coupon that expires in a short period at a food establishment in the area they were driving in. 

We examine various data characteristics, answer some questions as prompted in the assignment, and then proceed to do our assessment and offer recommendations for **next steps**, including better-targeting coupon users. 

Most of the data analysis is done and explained in the notebook. In this README we explain a few salient points of the study done.
